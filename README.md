Welcome to the repository for the hackathon organized by **Innovation Council** and **Siddaganga TBI**. This repository is a central hub for storing and collaborating on data related to our hackathon project.

### Problem Statement

Urban agriculture is constrained by: Urban areas face challenges in growing fresh produce due to limited space,resource inefficiencies, and reliance on imported food. This increases costs, environmental impact, and food insecurity. There is a need for a sustainable and accessible solution to enable food production in constrained urban environments.Land scarcity in densely populated areas.
Lack of expertise in crop selection and farming techniques suitable for specific climates.Complexity of managing hydroponic systems (e.g., nutrient balancing, environmental control).These challenges limit adoption, efficiency, and scalability in urban farming. Our platform bridges this gap by providing users with accessible tools and insights for vertical farming, thus addressing food security and sustainability issues.

## Project Description

The Vertical Farming Assistance Platform empowers urban farmers by:
• Analyzing Climate Data: Uses location-based weather data to recommend suitable crops.
• Providing Cultivation Guides: Offers detailed, step-by-step instructions from seeding to harvest.
• Managing Hydroponics: Delivers precise guidelines for nutrient concentration, pH balance, and water flow.
• Yield Predictions: Helps users estimate productivity and plan better.
• Disease Management: Identifies potential issues and suggests remedies.
• The platform is accessible, interactive, and designed for urban farmers with varying levels of expertise.

## Technologies Used

-Frontend Technologies:
• React.js for dynamic interfaces.
• Leaflet.js for mapping and location visualization.
• Material-UI for a polished and user-friendly design.
Backend Technologies:
• Node.js and Express.js for robust API development.
Database:
• MongoDB/PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
APIs:
• OpenWeather API to gather real-time climate data.
This technology stack ensures scalability, reliability, and an excellent user experience.
